# AICTE-Water-resource-management-project
This project focuses on AI-powered water resource management using the Water Potability dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting into training/testing sets. Machine Learning models are applied to predict whether water is safe or unsafe based on physicochemical parameters.
